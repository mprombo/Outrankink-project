Outrankink-project
==================

Functions for designing, executing and sharing Multiple Criteria Decision Making methods, algorithms and experiments
The outranking methods constitute one of the most fruitful approach in the field of Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM).
They main feature is to compare all feasible alternatives or actions by pair building up some binary relations, crisp or fuzzy, and then exploit in appropriate way these relations in order to obtain final recommendations.
This project aim to implement R package functions for designing, executing and sharing Multiple Criteria Decision Making methods, algorithms and experiments, according to the three main problematics: choosing, ranking and sorting.
